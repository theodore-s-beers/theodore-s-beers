Iâ€™m a **research software engineer** with a particular love for the digital humanities, and a classically trained Persian and Arabic philologist (PhD UChicago, 2020) with an active [research agenda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dqd1ahUAAAAJ).

My most recent full-time role (2024â€“25) was in the Colleges of Engineering and [Computing & Informatics](https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/) at Drexel University in Philadelphia, where I worked as the primary software engineer on an NSF-funded project that involved (*inter alia*) setting up and administering a cluster of GPU servers to be used by researchers for training machine learning models. Many of my responsibilities fell under the umbrella of what might be called **Research DevOps/MLOps**.

Iâ€™m still based in the Philadelphia area, with no plans to move, and Iâ€™m **looking for my next professional challenge**, be it on a full-time, part-time, or contract basis. I would be especially interested in consulting/contract work for academic research projectsâ€”though I understand (as we all must) the difficulties of the current research funding environment. Try `curl`ing my rÃ©sumÃ© API:

```sh
curl -s https://resume.theobeers.com/ | jq '{name, tagline, links}'

Prior to my engagement at Drexel, I spent several years as a postdoc in the [Seminar for Semitic and Arabic Studies](https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/en/e/semiarab/) at the Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin. I still collaborate with that group, maintaining an affiliation as a non-resident fellow, and I try to visit as often as I can. *Deutschland, besonders Berlin, wird fÃ¼r mich auf ewig ein Herzensort bleiben.*

Anyway, regardless of where I am, Iâ€™m an avid programmer in several languages (Rust, Python, TypeScript, Goâ€¦), and on GitHub I like to build web apps, CLI tools, and software libraries to facilitate my research and that of my colleagues around the world.

My homepage is at [theobeers.com](https://www.theobeers.com/). I can be reached by email using any valid prefix at that domain.
