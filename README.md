I’m a Persian and Arabic philologist and “digital humanist,” currently working as a postdoc in the [AnonymClassic project](https://www.geschkult.fu-berlin.de/en/e/kalila-wa-dimna/) at the Freie Universität Berlin. On GitHub, I like to build simple web apps and libraries to facilitate my research and that of my colleagues.

My homepage is at <https://www.theobeers.com/>.
